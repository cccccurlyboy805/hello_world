hi!Can you copy that?
I'm gonna tell you something about the TV show i have just watched and something i have thought because of it.It's quite embarrassing,especially for the couple of ZHENGSHUANG.Her boyfriend is like a human helium,cause he barely reply to what she said.But i have think about it once again and i found that it seem i also do not have the ability to answer a question in a hilarious way,and that bother me a lot.Anyway,i do not like this kind way of talking.I also want to be the focus of a group of people,but sometimes i would be scared for i am afraid people would find what i am talking about uninteresting.
